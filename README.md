# Intersection Functions
https://github.com/alt-shiftov/Houdini-Snippets/tree/main/Intersection
I was trying to explore how intersections work in 3D graphics, so I made a collection of basic functions designed to find intersections in 3D space.
These functions cover various intersection scenarios, including:

- **Line-Line**
- **Segment-Segment**
- **Segment-Curve**
- **Line-Plane**
- **Plane-Plane**
- **Segment-Triangle**
- **Triangle-Triangle**
- **Segment-Planar Quad**
- **Segment-Bilinear Patch** (both planar and non-planar quad)
