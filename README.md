## Basic 3D Graphics Functions (Intersection / Nearest Distance / Projection) 

### [Intersection Functions](VEX/Intersection)
I was trying to explore how intersections work in 3D graphics, so I made a collection of basic functions designed to find intersections in 3D space.
These functions cover various intersection scenarios, including:

- **Line-Line**
- **Segment-Segment**
- **Segment-Curve**
- **Line-Plane**
- **Plane-Plane**
- **Segment-Triangle**
- **Triangle-Triangle**
- **Segment-Planar Quad**
- **Segment-Bilinear Patch** (both planar and non-planar quad)

Using these functions, I've created an analog to the "Intersection Analysis" Node:

### [Nearest Distance (Geometric Tools)](VEX/NearestDistance)
This collection of functions is designed to find the nearest distances between various geometric entities. <br>
Based on functions from [Geometric Tools](https://github.com/davideberly/GeometricTools/):

- **dist_point_segment**
- **dist_segment_segment**
- **dist_line_line**
- **dist_line_segment**
- **dist_line_triangle**
- **dist_pt_triangle**
- **dist_segment_triangle**
- **dist_triangle_triangle**

### [Projection](VEX/Projection)
Projection simply involves finding the minimal distance.
This can be achieved using [Near Distance Functions](VEX/NearestDistance) (Geometric Tools Functions).

However, I found another implementations that might also be useful.
These functions project a point onto: line, segment, plane, triangle, planar and non-planar quad.

# Nodes

## Edge Preservation
Houdiniâ€™s basic nodes don't always preserve edge groups well during geometry operations. This collection of nodes is designed to handle geometry while maintaining edge groups.

These nodes were developed during the creation of my custom Boolean fracture system, which can be found in the Shatterizer repo.

**Transfer Edge**: More accurate edge group transfer compared to Transfer Groups.
**Split Points Preserve Edges**: Splits points while preserving edge groups.
**Fuse Preserve Edges**: Fuses points while keeping edge groups intact.
**Remesh Preserve Edges**: Remeshes geometry while transferring and preserving edge groups.
**Copy Edge Groups**: Copies edge groups, with an option to copy by ID.


## Intersection and Shattering
These nodes were created to better understand intersection operations in Houdini.

- **Intersection Analysis Custom:** A custom version of the **Intersection Analysis node**, which can be slightly faster than the original. Like the original node, it can store *sourceprim*, *sourceinput*, and *sourceprimuv* attributes. 
Additionally, it can **split lines** based on the primitives they belong to and store information about which **edges** points are associated with.

- **Surface Shatter**: A basic version of a Boolean shatter node using Surface Mode. This node is a work in progress, and I'm continuing to improve it. It offers two methods for generating cutting surfaces, though it is still somewhat clunky.


## Handling Pieces

- **Separate Pieces**: This node is essential for processing multiple pieces. It separates pieces from each other using their piece attribute, allowing you to iterate through them simultaneously. This is useful for tasks like generating captures between identical pieces, transferring attributes, or fusing by pieces. It is much faster than using a foreach loop or piece groups. This method is based on the "Point Deform" node.

- **Bound Pieces** - generate bound for pieces
- **Match Size Piece** - make Match Size for pieces


## Useful for simulations

- **RBD Split:** Optimizes RBD setups by identifying pieces that are static or moving below a certain speed threshold. This can be helpful when exporting RBDs to FBX. Instead of exporting all pieces, you can export only the moving pieces with animation and export static pieces as static geometry.

- **Dejitter**: Removes jittering from animated points over time, especially useful for handling jittery simulations like cloth.

- **Fuse Generate / Fuse Extract**: A pair of nodes for fusing points and extracting values from the fused points.
	- **Fuse Generate**: Fuses points and generates attributes for use with the Fuse Extract node.

	- **Fuse Extract**: Extracts attributes from fused geometry and applies them to unfused geometry. These nodes are useful for simulations where geometry needs to be fused, such as simulating cloth or wires. After the simulation, the animated attributes are transferred back to the original unfused geometry.


## Deformation and Skeleton Export

- **RBD to FBX**: Prepares rigid body animations for FBX export.

- **Deform to FBX**: Converts deforming geometry into bone deformation for FBX export. Works with multiple pieces.

- **pCapt to boneCapt**: Converts point capture data to bone capture data. This node allows you to generate capture data between geometry and a skeleton using Point Deform, then convert it to bone capture deformation. Result will be work with the Bone Deform node.

- **Spline Deformer**: Deforms geometry based on a spline, capable of handling multiple pieces. It uses **primitive UVW** and **point deformation** and has an OpenCL implementation for better performance.


## Additional Nodes

- **UV Transfer**: Transfers UVs from one geometry to another. It's similar to the Labs UV Transfer node but much, much faster.

- **Remesh Inside Faces**: Remeshes the inside faces after a Voronoi fracture, generating uniform polygons. Ensures that every point on a polygon has a corresponding point on neighboring pieces. This node can also add noise to the remeshed inside faces.

- **View Hedges**: A node for visualizing half-edges (hedges).

- **Peak by Mask** / **Smooth by Mask**: Peaks and smooths geometry based on a mask.
