## Basic 3D Graphics Functions (Intersection / Nearest Distance / Projection) 

### [Intersection Functions](VEX/Intersection)
I was trying to explore how intersections work in 3D graphics, so I made a collection of basic functions designed to find intersections in 3D space.
These functions cover various intersection scenarios, including:

- **Line-Line**
- **Segment-Segment**
- **Segment-Curve**
- **Line-Plane**
- **Plane-Plane**
- **Segment-Triangle**
- **Triangle-Triangle**
- **Segment-Planar Quad**
- **Segment-Bilinear Patch** (both planar and non-planar quad)

Using these functions, I've created an analog to the "Intersection Analysis" Node:

### [Nearest Distance (Geometric Tools)](VEX/NearestDistance)
This collection of functions is designed to find the nearest distances between various geometric entities. <br>
Based on functions from [Geometric Tools](https://github.com/davideberly/GeometricTools/):

- **dist_point_segment**
- **dist_segment_segment**
- **dist_line_line**
- **dist_line_segment**
- **dist_line_triangle**
- **dist_pt_triangle**
- **dist_segment_triangle**
- **dist_triangle_triangle**

### [Projection](VEX/Projection)
Projection simply involves finding the minimal distance.
This can be achieved using [Near Distance Functions](VEX/NearestDistance) (Geometric Tools Functions).

However, I found another implementations that might also be useful.
These functions project a point onto: line, segment, plane, triangle, planar and non-planar quad.
